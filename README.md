Headless minecraft Java Edition

This is for the H_Bot, It will be written in Python3 and is a basic program, it allows the user to send messages, recieve information and overall query the Minecraft Server. It is entirely based off https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft, Of which is the main library, however I have edited some things to suite it more to my use case, All code is Apache License 2.0 (as in LICENSE.md), Much alike ammaraskar/pyCraft. Basically, do what you want.
